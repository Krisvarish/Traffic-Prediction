# 🚦 Traffic Flow Prediction using Machine Learning

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for **predicting traffic flow patterns**.  
This project leverages **Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn** to preprocess data, train predictive models, and generate insights that can be used for smart city traffic management.

---

## 🌍 Overview

Efficient traffic management is critical in urban areas. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to:  

- Predict **traffic congestion** levels.  
- Support **smart mobility planning**.  
- Enable **real-time signal optimization**.  

The solution is built around **deep learning models**, trained on synthetic datasets, but easily extendable to real-world traffic data.
