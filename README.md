   ```python
   # Ensure consistent feature order
   feature_columns = ['hour', 'day_of_week', 'month', 'volume']
   ```

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
import pickle

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('synthetic_traffic_data.csv')

# Load model and scaler
model = keras.models.load_model('traffic_model.keras')
with open('scaler.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    scaler = pickle.load(f)

# Prepare prediction data
current_time = pd.Timestamp.now()
features = np.array([[
    current_time.hour,
    current_time.dayofweek,
    current_time.month,
    100  # current traffic volume
]])

# Scale and predict
scaled_features = scaler.transform(features)
prediction = model.predict(scaled_features)

print(f"Predicted traffic in next hour: {prediction[0][0]:.2f} vehicles")
```
